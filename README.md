This game is currently in the works and unreleased for some of the information below might not be a necessory to read until the game is out
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Imagine tetris, You push buttons to move pieces and clear lines.<br>
But what if you the buttons you pressed changes as you play the game.<br>
Sounds confusing and annoying right? That's Tetrerret


### How to play

This game assumes that you have played tetris before so it might be difficult if you haven't.<br>
If (for some reason) you haven't played tetris before then I *really* recommend you give it a shot, even if you don't play tetrerret.<br>
You can play at the official tetris site [here](https://tetris.com/play-tetris)
<br/>
You'll be able to find a link to tetrerret when it ready here, check again in the future!
