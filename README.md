## Tetrerret

Imagine tetris, You push buttons to move pieces and clear lines.<br>
But what if you the buttons you pressed changes as you play the game.<br>
Sounds confusing and annoying right? That's Tetrerret


### How to play

This game assumes that you have played tetris before so it might be difficult if you haven't.<br>
If (for some reason) you haven't played tetris before then I *really* recommend you give it a shot, even if you don't play tetrerret.<br>
You can play at the [official site](https://tetris.com/play-tetris) or at another site such as [tetrio](https://tetr.io/)


### The idea

A good friend of mine made a joke, I took it seriously.
